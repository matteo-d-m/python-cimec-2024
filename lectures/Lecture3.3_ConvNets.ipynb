    "- **Input channels (`in_channels`):** the inputs to a convolution can be elementary (like our black-and-white images), or they can result from the combination of multiple sub-inputs (like colour images, which are a combination of a Red, a Green, and a Blue image - RGB). When the input is elementary, the convolution is said to have one _input channel_. But when the input is a combination of multiple sub-inputs, the convolution is said to have _multiple_ input channels. If our input images were coloured, the convolution would have 3 input channels (one for R, one for G, and for B). In case of multiple input channels, the convolution kernel operates over each channel and the results are summed element-wise into one single feature map. But we don't care about that for now, because our inputs have a single channel (they are black and white)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Output channels (`out_channels`):** the number of feature maps that the convolution layer should produce. Note that to produce $n$ feature maps, we need $n$ kernels - therefore, setting the number of output channels is equivalent to setting the number of kernels that we want to use. Using multiple kernels increases the chances of building strong knowledge of the input (see below for a more detailed explanation)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flatten (`nn.Flatten`):** after using multiple kernels, we want to collapse all corresponding feature maps into a single vector to feed to the standard layers. To do so, we reshape each feature map into a one-dimensional tensor (i.e., we _flatten_ it) and we concatenate the result into one big vector. This is done by the `Flatten` class contained in PyTorch's `nn` package\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Linear (`nn.Linear`):** just a synonym for _standard neural network layer_, emphasizing that the layer implements a linear transformation of the input. Other synonyms that you might find are _fully connected_ and _dense_, which both emphasize how all elements of the input contribute to each element of the output (in contrast to convolutional layers, where each input patch gives rise to a well-defined portion of the feature map due to the local nature of convolutions)\n",

    "    - The input features are constrained by the size of the input tensor - be it data or the output of a previous layer. In our case, we have `in_features = 4*4*20` because the second convolutional layer outputs 20 feature maps, each of which is $4$ x $4$. This means that after flattening, we have a vector with $4$ x $4$ x $20$ = $320$ elements\n",
    "    - The output features are arbitrary\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout (`nn.Dropout`):** this is a special type of layer that turns randomly selected weights into $0$, with a given probability ([Srivastava et al., 2014](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v15/srivastava14a.html)). While relatively obscure from the theoretical standpoint, dropout is proven to improve learning "
